## About this Project

Personal React quiz web app created using Next.js. Technologies used in this project include React and Express.js. Retrieves up to 10 questions with various topics and difficulties from [QuizAPI](https://quizapi.io/) in order to quiz yourself on various technological topics.

Originally used a small Express.js server to handle API calls but swapped to using Cloudflare workers instead due to an issue with heroku.
